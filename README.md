# KanbanFire

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

## Introduction

Project built with [Angular and Firebase](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/building-a-web-app-with-angular-and-firebase#0). In this codelab, we'll build a web kanban board with Angular and Firebase! Our final app will have three categories of tasks: backlog, in progress, and completed. We'll be able to create, delete tasks, and transfer them from one category to another using drag and drop.

We'll develop the user interface using Angular and use Firestore as our persistent store. At the end of the codelab we'll deploy the app to Firebase Hosting using the Angular CLI.

## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
